+ **Project Summary**:  
In this project, we have implemented two different methods for image deblurring using GAN, introduced in [DeblurGAN: Blind Motion Deblurring Using Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07064.pdf). The [peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio) metric then has been applied to evaluate the two models. As shown in the table below, the approach introduced in the first paper is better.
